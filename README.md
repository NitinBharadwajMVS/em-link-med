## Hospital Recommendation AI

This project integrates Groq AI for intelligent hospital recommendations based on patient vitals, triage level, and hospital capabilities.

### Configuration

The Groq API key is currently configured in `/supabase/functions/config/keys.ts` for development purposes. 

To add your Groq API key:
1. Open `supabase/functions/config/keys.ts`
2. Replace `"your_groq_api_key_here"` with your actual Groq API key
3. Get a free API key from [https://console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)

### Switching to Environment Variables

Once environment variables become available in your deployment, you can migrate to using `GROQ_API_KEY` from `process.env` or Supabase secrets:

```typescript
// The edge function automatically checks env vars first:
const apiKey = Deno.env.get('GROQ_API_KEY') || GROQ_API_KEY;
```

No code changes are required - just add the `GROQ_API_KEY` to your Supabase secrets or environment variables, and the system will automatically use it instead of the config file.

### Features

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Uses Groq's Llama 3.3 70B model to analyze patient conditions and recommend optimal hospitals
- **Graceful Fallback**: Automatically switches to deterministic algorithm if API key is missing or API fails
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows "ðŸ¤– AI Recommendation Active" when using AI, or "âš¡ Offline Recommendation Mode" for fallback
- **Confidence Scores**: Each recommendation includes a confidence percentage and detailed reasoning
- **Equipment Matching**: Considers required medical equipment and hospital specialties
